The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations on values. However, there's a common error: using `calc()` with percentages in a way that CSS doesn't expect.  For example, consider:

```css
.box {
  width: calc(50% + 20px);
}
```
This works fine. But attempting to use a percentage based on a calculation is problematic: 

```css
.box {
  width: calc(50% + 20% );
}
/* INCORRECT */
.box {
  width: calc( (100% - 50%) / 2);
}
/* INCORRECT */
```
The second example attempts to calculate 50% of the containing element, but the second half of the equation is not a fixed width value. It results in `NaN` (Not a Number).

Another error related to `calc()` involves whitespace. Always ensure there are no spaces between the operators and the values in the `calc()` expression. Incorrect spacing leads to incorrect calculations.

```css
/*INCORRECT SPACING */
.box { width: calc( 50% + 20px ); }
```
